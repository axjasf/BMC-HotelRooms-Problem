This program is about grouping numbers in a special way using three different rules. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Three Rules for Calculating Numbers:**
   - **f(n)**: Just gives back the same number \(n\).
   - **g(n)**: Takes \(n\), multiplies it by 3, and adds 1.
   - **h(n)**: Takes \(n\) and adds 81.

2. **Grouping the Results:**
   - For each number \(n\) (starting from 1 up to the maximum number you choose), the program applies the three rules (f, g, h) to calculate three values.
   - It tries to put those values into groups. If any of the values already belong to an existing group, it adds all the new values to that group. If not, it creates a new group for them.

3. **Tracking the Number of Groups:**
   - As the program goes through each number, it keeps track of how many groups there are in total.

4. **Showing Results:**
   - The program can show the results in different ways:
     - **Print the groups**: It can show the values inside each group.
     - **Print the group sizes**: It can show how many numbers are in each group.
     - **Plot a graph**: If you choose, it will draw a graph that shows how the number of groups changes as \(n\) gets bigger.
